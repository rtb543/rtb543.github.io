					<h1>Dress Code</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					There is no strict dress code - we’d love everyone to feel comfortable, colourful and themselves. The venue is set among the woods, so think practical shoes, layers for the evening and anything you don’t mind getting a bit of grass or glitter on. 

					Feel free to lean into fun, floral and woodland-inspired colours, or go full disco if that is your thing! Sequins, fur coats, face paint, fancy dress - all welcome! 

					If you’d like some inspiration, we’ve put together a Pinterest Board with a few ideas.

			<!-- Packing List-->

					<h1>Packing List</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					As we have the run of the venue for the whole weekend, there’s plenty of space and time for activities and chill time. You don’t need to bring anything special, but here are a few things that might come in handy: 
					A swimming costume and towel (for the lake and sauna) 
					Warm layers and sturdy shoes (for evenings outdoors) 
					Fancy dress or something fun if you feel like it 
					Any board games, musical instruments or craft materials
					Your favourite snacks or drinks (there is a large communal kitchen space) 

					None of this is required - just some ideas to help you make the most of the weekend!
				</p>
			</section>

			<!-- Food & Drink -->
			<section id="foodanddrink">
				<header>
					<h1>Food &amp; Drink</h1>
				</header>
				<p>
					Friday 
						Pot luck! For those with us from Friday, we are planning a casual potluck dinner. If you are able to bring something homemade (or shop-bought!) to share, that would be wonderful. 

					Some easy ideas:
					Salads or pasta salad
					Quiche or pie 
					Bread and dips or crudites
					Brownies or cookies 
					Cheese and crackers 
					Fruit 
					Cupcakes 
					Packets of crisps or biscuits 

					But absolutely no pressure. We know that not everyone will have the space or time to prep food and that is completely fine. There is also a communal kitchen on site for those who want to cook or store things - no one will go hungry. 

					Saturday
						Communal brunch 
						Snacks
						Wedding breakfast (Menu coming soon) 
						Late-night nibbles 

					Sunday
						Breakfast and light lunch for those still around 

					Drinks
						We will be providing lots of beverages, but please bring your own supply if you wish! 

					If you have any dietary requirements, please let us know via the Google Form.
